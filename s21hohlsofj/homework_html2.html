		<p><em>Peaky Blinders</em> is a British crime drama television series created by Steven Knight. Set in Birmingham, England, it follows the exploits of the Peaky Blinders crime gang in the direct aftermath of the First World War. The fictional gang is loosely based on a real urban youth gang of the same name who were active in the city from the 1880s to the 1910s.</p>

		<img src="234.jpg" alt="Thomas Shelby">
		<p class="related-panel">Thomas served in World War I with the rank of Sergeant Major and was decorated for bravery (Though he dumped them in a canal after returning from the war). His experiences in World War I left him disillusioned and beset with ongoing nightmares, and he becomes determined to move his family up in the world so that the powers who had always mistreated them could no longer touch them.</p>

		<h3>Arthur Shelby</h3>
		<img src="33.jpg" alt="Arthur Shelby">
		<p>Arthur Shelby Jr. was born to a Romani and Irish Traveller family. Growing up, Arthur regularily wrestled with his siblings and was known as the strongest. He once got beaten by Tommy, he also once held off 12 police officers with a boat hook, showing that he let Tommy win. It is implied he had anger issues as a child and got into many fights. During the war in France, Arthur was a Sapper with his brother Thomas, digging very treacherous tunnels in order to place enormous amount of explosives under the enemy positions: a tactic used several times in the war to devastating effect at both the Battle of Verdun and the Battle of the Somme. It is suggested he may have served at Gallipoli through his distaste for Turks and the smell of stagnant water.</p>
